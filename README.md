📊 Project Summary
This project demonstrates my ability to execute a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI. I transformed raw customer transaction data into structured insights by performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, SQL-based business querying, and interactive dashboard development.
Through this analysis, I identified key customer segments, revenue drivers, and purchasing patterns, translating data into actionable business recommendations focused on improving retention and profitability.
This project reflects real-world analyst responsibilities data preparation, metric design, stakeholder focused reporting, and strategic insight generation.
